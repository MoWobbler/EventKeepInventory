# EventKeepInventory
Minecraft plugin with a command that allows players to keep their inventory on death

First Plugin I've made with help from https://github.com/C4K3/Events

I've only started learning Java this month so the code is probably messy and inefficient

I plan on adding this to the Events plugin next
